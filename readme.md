# Simple Full Stack Social Media App

Welcome to the Simple Full Stack Social Media App! This application is a basic social media platform that allows users to connect, share posts, and interact with each other. It is built using a combination of technologies including ReactJS, NodeJS, Express, and MySQL with the Sequelize.js ORM.

## Features
- User Authentication: Users can sign up and log in to the application. Passwords are securely hashed and stored in the database.

- Create and Edit Posts: Authenticated users can create new posts and edit their existing posts. Posts can include text, images, or a combination of both.

- Like and Comment: Users can like and comment on posts made by others, promoting interaction and engagement within the community.

- User Profiles: Each user has a profile that displays their information, including their username, profile picture, and a list of their posts.

- News Feed: The home page of the app displays a news feed of posts from all users, allowing users to easily discover and interact with content.

## Technologies Used
- **ReactJS**: The frontend of the application is built using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **NodeJS**: The backend of the application is built using NodeJS, providing a fast and scalable server environment.

- **Express**: Express is used as the backend framework to handle routing, requests, and responses.

- **MySQL** with **Sequelize.js** ORM: The MySQL database is used to store user information, posts, comments, and likes. Sequelize.js is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that simplifies database interactions.
